# Telegram Bot

In addition to the chatbot integrated into the web app and extension, KeeperC also provides a Telegram bot ([@keeperc_bot](https://t.me/+8l6TVyQhoSI4YWJl)) that allows you to use the chatbot via the popular messaging app.
You can join KeeperC's Telegram group (https://t.me/+8l6TVyQhoSI4YWJl) to access the KeeperC chatbot and connect with other users to discuss the latest updates and features of the wallet.

The bot works in the same way as the chatbot in the web app and extension, providing natural language support and suggesting features and functions on KeeperC that you can use.
