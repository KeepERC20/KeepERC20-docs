# Fraud Detection

KeeperC comes with a fraud detection system that monitors your transactions and alerts you if any suspicious activity is detected. This feature helps protect you from potential hacks, scams, and phishing attacks.

<!-- TODO: image -->

Current fraud detection in KeeperC is denylist-based phishing address detection. This feature compares the address you are sending tokens to against a denylist of known phishing addresses. If a match is found, KeeperC will alert you and prevent the transaction from going through, protecting your tokens from being sent to a fraudulent address.

To ensure the highest level of security, KeeperC's denylist is constantly updated to include the latest phishing addresses.
Additionally, if you encounter a new phishing address that is not on the denylist, you can report it to [KeeperC's support team](mailto:lukepark327@gmail.com), and they will investigate and add it to the denylist if necessary.
